            Our founder, Braydon Roberts, disliked cats for the majority of his life. His wife, on the other hand, absolutely adored them. One day they decided to get get their first cat.
            Mallory had told Braydon that the main reason why people don't like cats is because they dont understand them. Braydon decided to give the domestic cat a fair chance and to his surprise, his wife's statement was right. 
            Almost a year after they had gotten a cat, Braydon had a school project where he had to build a website. He had been brainstorming for hours, trying to think of what the topic of his website should be.
            When he asked his wife for any ideas, she mentioned that he could make a website about cats. After that moment, he knew exactly what he wanted to do for his project.
            He wanted to start a website that would help people learn what he did, and Felis-Catus-R-Us was created.
