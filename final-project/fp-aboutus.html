            About Us:
        </h1>
        <p>
            Our founder, Braydon Roberts, disliked cats for the majority of his life. His wife, on the other hand, absolutely adored them. One day the couple had decided to get get their first cat. Mallory had told Braydon that the main reason why people don't like cats is because they dont understand them. As time had passed by Braydon had found out that she was right. Braydon decided to give the domestic cat a fair chance so they got their.    Felis-Catus-R-Us was created in February of 2022 when our founder, Braydon Roberts, had a school assignment where he had to build a website. He had been brainstorming for hours, trying to think of what the topic of his website should be. When he asked his wife for any ideas she mentioned that he could make a website about cats.
